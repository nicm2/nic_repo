## Key Learning (Tech Talks)
- Recursive sequences/functions are functions that call themselves to loop
- Ex: fibonacci
- While, for, and recursive loops to repeat code (while built in counter, for is specified)

Week 0: 
```py try: 
        f = open("demofile.txt")
        try:
          f.wrtie("Lorum Ipsum")
        except:
          print("Something went wrong when writing to the file")
        finally:
          f.close()
      except:
        print("Something went wrong when opening the file")```
