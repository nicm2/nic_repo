### 2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?

The issue with technology and its addictivness steams from a chemical in our brain known as dopamine. Over time we develop a desire for the dopamine release that comes from using technology which compels students and others to use technology more often. This is a real problem that is very common in High School students and affects their study and success by not only acting as a distraction from school work but also decreasing the students mood because dopamine from technology tricks the brain and prevents dopamine from being produced naturally.
