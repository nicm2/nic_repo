## Tri 3 TPT 2.0 Legal and Ethical Concerns 5.5

### 1. When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in GitHub pages.

- Mit License: This is the license I chose for my individual repository and the license my team decided to choose for our PBL project. MIT License is an open source license that allows code to be used freely, distributed, and published. This works for our project as we are created software to be used by a sponsor
- GPL License: This is another open source license but is slightly more restrictive as it limits distributing closed source versions
- Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal: This license or Public Domain that relinquishes all copyright and similar rights that you hold in a work and dedicating those rights to the public domain.

### 2. Make a license for your personal and Team project. Document license you picked and why.

## Tri 3 TPT 2.0 Safe Computing 5.6

### 1. Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.

While working on my PBL project for CompSci Principles (tutoring) I have noticed a couple PII issues. These issues mainly come in a notes feature and forum page of our project. The notes feature is supposed to be individual to each user and if leaked could expose personal information. We plan to use a login and sign in feature to keep information stored in notes or calendar features private.

### 2. What are your feelings about PII and your exposure?

Personal information is very important nowadays and is often taken advantage of and used to hurt people. It is important to keep personal information private and limit exposure or else you could face serious consequences. It is important companies that develop applications and resources emphasis PII. 

### 3. Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.

Good passwords would be random combinations of letters, numbers and special characters that have no tie to the user. A bad password would be a simple series of numbers (123) or something like a dog's name or their name. Two factor authentication is another step used to assist in authentication as it requires two forms of proof that the user is the account owner.

### 4. Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.

Symmetric encryption uses a single key shared among users who need to recieve specific data, while Asymetric encription uses a public and private key to decrypt data or messages while communicating

### 5. Provide and example of encryption we used in deployment.

In deployment we use HTTPS that has encryption as it is SSL certified in order to increase security and encryption of our website.

### 6. Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.

One phishing scheme I have learned about the hard way is recieving an email that told me my account for a game I played was getting deleted and I needed to click a link to stop it. This is the most common type of phising, through emails. Hackers send emails saying the user's account is compromised and you need to click a link. Other phising techniques including targeting companies (groups).

# College Board Notes

## 5.5

- Material created on a computer is the intellectual property of the creator or an organization
- Ease of access and distribution of digitized information raises inteelectual property concerns regarding ownership, value, and use
- Measures should be taken to safeguard intellectual property

## 5.6

- Information placed online can be used in ways that were not intended and that may have a harmful impact. For example, an email message may be forwarded, tweets can be retweeted, and social media posts can be viewed by potential employers
- PII can be used to stalk or steal the identity of a person or to aid in the planning of other criminal acts
- Authentication measures protect devies and information from unauthorized access. Examples of authentication measures include strong passwords and multifactor authentication
- A strong password is something that is easy for a user to remeber, but would be difficult for someone else to guess based on knowledge of that user
- Phishing is a technique that attempts to trick a user into providing personal information. That personal information can then be used to access sensitive online resources, such as bank accounts and emails
- Key logging is the use of a program to record every keystroke made by a computer user in order to gain fraudulent access to passwords and other confidential information
