# College Board Notes

## 5.3

- Computing innovations can reflect existing human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation
- Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases
- Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development

## 5.4

- Widespread access to information and public data facilitates the identification of problems, development of solutions, and dissemination of results
- Science has been affected by using distributed and "citizen science" to solve scientific problems
- Citizen science is scientific research codnucted in whole or part by distributed individuals, many of whom may not be scientists, who contribute relevant data to research using their own computing devices
