## Tri 3 TPT 1.0 Computing Bias 5.3

### HP Computers are racist video thoughts

Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?
If yes or no, justify you conclusion.
How do you think this happened?
Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?
Should it be corrected?
What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?
- I don't think the owner thinks it was intentional but a training error in the software most likely caused by only using white rather than people of color for the technology. It is harmful, while unintentional, as it excludes a large population of people and is targeted toward a certain ethnicity. It prevents a specific group of people from utilizing the new technology. I think it should be corrected as it is unfair that people of color are discriminated against. To produce a better outcome, HP should use training data with people of color to code for the software.

## Tri 3 TPT 1.1 Crowdsourcing 5.4

### CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
- Our environment could include a page about CSP AP exam which includes important topics, tpt notes, and more. We could implement crowdsouring into the project to allow everyone to add to the study/tutoring page to make a helpful resource for everyone that covers a wide range of topics and backgrounds.

### What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?
- Our project could easily use crowdsourcing to optimize its efficieny and be a better resource. Our idea to implement crowdsourcing would be to use a forum or page to add notes and resources in order to improve our tutoring website needs. We want for people to be able to help others and contribute information and work to make a website that can aid students in a variety of topics.

# College Board Notes

## 5.3

- Computing innovations can reflect existing human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation
- Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases
- Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development

## 5.4

- Widespread access to information and public data facilitates the identification of problems, development of solutions, and dissemination of results
- Science has been affected by using distributed and "citizen science" to solve scientific problems
- Citizen science is scientific research codnucted in whole or part by distributed individuals, many of whom may not be scientists, who contribute relevant data to research using their own computing devices
