## Quiz 3 Test Corrections

### Question 6
I got Question 6 wrong because I put A and C when the answer was A and D. The answer was D because the algorithm displays the numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, and 20. After 20 is displayed, x is incremented to 21. The value 21 is not displayed since it is a multiple of 3 and the algorithm terminates.

### Question 30
I got Question 6 wrong because I put B when the answer was D. The answer was D because the Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses protocols to connect devices worldwide. The World Wide Web is an information system (of pages, programs, and files) that is accessible over the Internet.
